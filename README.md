## üìñ Project Overview

**Football Booking Manager** is a web application designed to manage football field bookings. The project provides key features such as booking football fields, managing invoices, and handling inventory for additional items (e.g., water, snacks). It is built as a RESTful API using **Spring Boot** (Java) and **MySQL**, with user authentication and role-based access control implemented using JWT.

This project was developed as part of my personal learning journey to deepen my understanding of backend development, Spring Boot, and RESTful API design.
